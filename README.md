# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Dashboard

 I am thrilled to share my latest project: a Telecom Customer Churn Dashboard built using Power BI, with data sourced from Kaggle! This dashboard aims to provide a detailed and actionable overview of customer churn insights, empowering telecom companies to make informed, data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and satisfaction.

The dashboard features several key performance indicators (KPIs) that offer a snapshot of the current business landscape. These include the total number of customers, total charges generated, and a breakdown of the customer base by gender (female and male). These KPIs are crucial for understanding the overall performance and customer demographics at a glance.

To facilitate in-depth analysis, I have included four interactive slicers. These slicers allow users to filter the data based on gender, payment method, internet service type, and marital status. This interactive feature enables users to customize their view and focus on specific segments of the customer base, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.

The dashboard also includes a variety of visualizations to present the data in an intuitive and accessible manner. Three donut charts illustrate total charges segmented by gender, contract type (month-to-month, one year, two years), and senior citizen status. These charts provide a clear visual representation of how different customer groups contribute to the overall revenue.

To highlight individual customer contributions, I have incorporated stacked bar charts showcasing the top five and bottom five customer IDs based on total charges. This allows businesses to recognize their most and least valuable customers, aiding in targeted retention strategies.

Furthermore, three stacked column charts offer insights into the relationship between tenure and charges, monthly charges by payment method, and total charges by payment method. These charts help identify how long-term customers differ from newer ones in terms of spending, and how payment preferences impact revenue.

One of the standout features of this dashboard is its ability to perform interactive data filtering. Users can slice and dice the data to gain specific insights tailored to their needs. This flexibility is crucial for businesses looking to conduct detailed analyses without getting lost in a sea of data.

Additionally, the dashboard includes trend analysis, with yearly tenure and monthly charges visualizations, to track customer engagement over time. This can help businesses understand how customer loyalty and spending evolve, enabling them to devise strategies to maintain or boost engagement.

Customer segmentation is another key aspect of the dashboard. By breaking down total charges by various demographics and service usage patterns, businesses can better understand their customer base and tailor their offerings to meet specific needs.

I am eager to receive your feedback on this dashboard! Your insights and suggestions will be invaluable in refining this tool to make it even more effective and user-friendly. Please explore the dashboard and share your thoughts on its functionality, usability, and any additional features you would like to see.

Thank you for your time and feedback! Together, we can make this tool a powerful asset for driving customer retention and business growth.
